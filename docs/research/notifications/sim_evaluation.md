# SIM Card Evaluation

I am testing three different SIM cards for this project: Sixfab/Twilio, Hologram, and Vodafone NZ.

## Sixfab/Twilio

This SIM card is a global SIM card that worked well for typical online data use. However, it did not have the ability to send SMS messages at all, although does allow device-to-device messaging

## Hologram

This is another global SIM card and works similarly to the Sixfab one. It does allow for sending SMS messages, however, this needs to be purchased separately for a recurring fee. Unfortunately, this service is not available in NZ.

## Vodafone NZ

<!-- TODO more investigation -->
This SIM card only works in NZ, but there are likely other local providers that support NB-IoT and/or Cat-M1. These will have a number associated with them, although this may require some setting up on a phone first. It's also possible that the mobile plan will not work on the modem (yes, this is a thing I've experienced).
